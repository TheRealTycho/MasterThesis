# Welcome
This repository contains notes associated to my Master's thesis for the AY 2025/2026 on the topic of 'One-dimesional Phases Protected by Topological Symmetry'. My thesis advisors are Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Anton Martin, and my promoter is prof. Frank Verstraete.

These notes aim to provide both a pedagogical introduction and to set notation. After the groundwork is done, I aim add more detail so that eventually I can use these as review material/ inspiration for the thesis itself.

Topics covered include:
- 
- Generalized Cluster States
- Gauging on the (1D) lattice
- Generalized Transverse Field Ising model
- String Order Paramters, and Interface Algebras

Appendix material:
- 
- (small) non-Abelian groups and their representation theory
- ...

Ideas:
-

TODO:
- Classification of SPTs based on G-symmetry => cocycles,...
- L-symbols for Z2xZ2
- L-symbols for Rep(D3)=Rep(S3)
- SOP for Rep(D3)

- numerically determining the GCGCs?

- REFERENCING!!!
