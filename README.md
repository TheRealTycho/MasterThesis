# Welcome
This repository contains notes associated to my Master's thesis for the AY 2025/2026 on the topic of 'One-dimesional Phases Protected by Topological Symmetry'. My thesis advisors are Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Anton Martin, and my promoter is prof. Frank Verstraete.

These notes aim to provide both a pedagogical introduction and to set notation. After the groundwork is done, I aim add more detail so that eventually I can use these as review material/ inspiration for the thesis itself.

Topics covered include:
- 
- Generalized Cluster States in (1+1)d AND (2+1)d
- Gauging on the (1D) lattice, AND on arbitrary graphs
- Generalized Transverse Field Ising model
- String Order Paramters
- Interface Algebras
- Group-based SPTOs

Appendix material:
- 
- (small) non-Abelian groups and their representation theory
-  

Ideas:
- Appendix: Projective representations, Cohomology
- Appendix: Category theory for Phycisists
- 

TODO:
- L-symbols for Rep(D3)=Rep(S3)(later)
- SOP for Rep(D3)(later)

- numerically determining the GCGCs?=> This might be (very) hard

- REFERENCING!!!=> Improving

- Proof for the Statement: Given that the Interface Algebra between phases L and R has no one-dimensional representations, conclude that L and R are different phases. (Proof by Contradiction?)

- (2+1)d Cluster State: Edge/Interface modes? + GS Degeneracy, String vs Sheet/Surface/Membrane Order Parameter, Topological response+Thouless Pump
- Family of $G$-cluster states by repeated action of preparation/construction circuit
- MBQC on the (2+1)d $G$-cluster state?
