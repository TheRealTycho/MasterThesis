# Welcome
This repository contains notes associated to my Master's thesis for the AY 2025/2026 on the topic of 'One-dimesional Phases Protected by Topological Symmetry'. My thesis advisors are Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Anton Martin, and my promoter is prof. Frank Verstraete.

These notes aim to provide both a pedagogical introduction and to set notation. After the groundwork is done, I aim add more detail so that eventually I can use these as review material/ inspiration for the thesis itself.

Topics covered include:

- Generalized Cluster States
- Gauging on the (1D) lattice
- and much more...

Appenix material:

- (small) non-Abelian groups and their representation theory
- ...


TODO:

- L-symbols for Z2xZ2
- L-symbols for Rep(D3)=Rep(S3)
- Interface Algebras: is this neccessary?
- SOP for Rep(D3)

- Gauging+duality map for Z2 => KW duality
- Gauging+duality map for G => GxG SSB to GxRep(G) GCS

- REFERENCING!!!
