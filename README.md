# Welcome
This repository contains notes associated to my Master's thesis for the AY 2025/2026 on the topic of 'One-dimesional Phases Protected by Topological Symmetry'. My thesis advisors are Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Anton Martin, and my promoter is prof. Frank Verstraete.

These notes aim to provide both a pedagogical introduction and to set notation. After the groundwork is done, I aim add more detail so that eventually I can use these as review material/ inspiration for the thesis itself.

Topics covered include:
- 
- Generalized Cluster States in (1+1)d AND (2+1)d
- Gauging on the (1D) lattice, AND on arbitrary graphs
- Generalized Transverse Field Ising model
- String Order Paramters
- Interface Algebras
- Group-based SPTOs

Appendix material:
- 
- (small) non-Abelian groups and their representation theory
-  

Ideas:
- Appendix: Projective representations, Cohomology
- Appendix: Category theory for Phycisists
- 

TODO:
- L-symbols for Rep(D3)=Rep(S3)
- SOP for Rep(D3)

- numerically determining the GCGCs?=> This might be (very) hard

- REFERENCING!!!=> Improving
