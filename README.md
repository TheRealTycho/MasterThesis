# Welcome
This repository contains notes associated to my Master's thesis for the AY 2025/2026 on the topic of 'One-dimesional Phases Protected by Topological Symmetry'. My thesis advisors are Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Anton Martin, and my promoter is prof. Frank Verstraete.

These notes aim to provide both a pedagogical introduction and to set notation. After the groundwork is done, I aim add more detail so that eventually I can use these as review material/ inspiration for the thesis itself.

Topics covered include:
$$
\begin{item}
  \item Generalized Cluster States
  \item Gauging on the (1D) lattice
  \items and much more...
\end{item}
$$
